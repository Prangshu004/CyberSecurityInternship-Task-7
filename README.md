# 🧩 Cybersecurity Internship – Task 7

## 📌 Task Title:
**Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions**

---

## 🧠 Objective:
To learn how browser extensions can pose security risks and to identify and remove any unused or suspicious extensions from a web browser. This improves browser performance and reduces the attack surface for malicious scripts or data leaks.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- **Browser:** Mozilla Firefox / Google Chrome
- **Extension Settings Menu**
- **Extension Stores (for review and permission checking)**

---

## 🧪 Experiment Steps:

### 🧩 Step 1: Opened Extension Manager
- Opened the browser’s extensions manager:
  - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
  - Firefox: `about:addons`

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Reviewed Installed Extensions

| Extension Name     | Description                         | Permissions Requested                | Risk Level       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| Dark Reader        | Night mode for websites             | Read/modify all websites             | ✅ Safe (popular) |
| Grammarly          | Writing assistant                   | Access to all input text             | ⚠️ Sensitive data |
| Unknown VPN Pro    | Free VPN extension (suspicious name)| Access to all browser activity       | ❌ Suspicious     |
| Screenshot Tool    | Take webpage screenshots            | Access to tabs and file system       | ✅ Low risk       |

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Removed Suspicious Extensions
- **Removed:** `Unknown VPN Pro`  
  🔎 Reason: No reviews, excessive permissions, unknown publisher

---

### 🧩 Step 4: Restarted Browser & Verified Performance
- Browser restarted and performance improved slightly
- No unknown pop-ups or redirections after removal

---

## 📋 Browser Extension Security Tips:

- ✅ Always review permissions before installing
- ✅ Avoid extensions that ask to "Read/Change all your data"
- ✅ Only install from trusted sources or well-reviewed developers
- ✅ Disable or remove extensions you no longer use
- ❌ Never install cracked/pirated plugins or adware-based add-ons

## 🔐 Risks of Malicious Extensions:

| Risk                          | Description                                               |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Theft**                | Can access form data, passwords, payment info             |
| **Tracking & Profiling**      | Collects your browsing history and sells to advertisers   |
| **Redirection & Ad Injection**| Hijacks search results or injects ads into web pages      |
